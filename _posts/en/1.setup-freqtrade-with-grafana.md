## Introduction

I spend ~2 week for setup freqtrade and dependencies on my personal raspberry PI4.

Above image is the simplify version of my setup, on real run I have machine performance monitor, reverse proxy, and postgres database, but I will not talking here.

## FTMetric

I create `ftmetric` docker image which publish on [docker.hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kamontat/ftmetric).
Due to repository of this project is attached to my personal configuration as well, so the source code is not published yet, but I'm trying to separate them out.

### How to use

If you familar with docker, you can run [helpful command](#ftmetric-helpful-command) section.

### FtMetric helpful command

> Warning you should fixed version of docker image for example `kamontat/ftmetric:v3.7.3` to avoid break change

```bash
# show help
docker run --rm -it kamontat/ftmetric --help
# show all config listed on this script
docker run --rm -it kamontat/ftmetric --list-config

docker run --rm -it kamontat/ftmetric \
  freqtrade.url=http://localhost:8080 \
  freqtrade.username=freqtrader \
  freqtrade.password=verysecretpassword
```
