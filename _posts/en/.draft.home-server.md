# Setup home server

Since last year, I brought 2 raspberry PI4 devices from [cytron.io](https://th.cytron.io/). I tried to setup home server using kubernetes but due to lack of maintainance so I decide to stop the server and left PI uptouch for couple of month. Last month I found one awesome repository for crypto bot [freqtrade](https://freqtrade.io). Couple of days of trying on digital ocean, I decide to hosted bot on my raspberry PI instead to avoid server payment that cause around 20$ per month. I will talk about my bot setup later on the next post.

## Running with private ip

Nowaday, network provider didn't give us a public IP so we have extra it to do for make our server reachable from outside world [howto](#setup-public-ip-with-cloudflare-argo)

## Setup public ip with Cloudflare Argo

We have 2 way to start cloudflare on server, either run by commandline or linux systemctl commands. The `systemctl` is the best way for running on production since you can specify restart algorithm and restart itself if server is down.
