## Knowledge Requirement

1. [docker](https://docker.com) - Basic requires for understand what is docker/docker-compose.

## Introduction

I spent ~2 week for setup freqtrade and dependencies on my personal raspberry PI4.

/assets/posts/3/dep-graph.png

Above image is the simplified version. How it works is `Prometheus` will call `ftmetric` to information and save to internal database. `Grafana` will fetch data from `Prometheus` via [PromQL][promql] and show it as beautiful graph.

## Setup

I'm using docker-compose as it support run multiple docker containers in single file and very easy to setup.

### Docker compose file

First you need **docker-compose.yml** file (more detail [here][docker-compose-docs]). This file will contain all component (docker container) you need to run full-stack freqtrade-grafana. If you not familar with yml syntax, you might take a look on [Wiki][yml-wiki]. If you don't know how to start, I provided simple [docker-compose.yml](#complete-docker-compose)

Important config in `docker-compose` file.

1. version - This should place on first line in the file (I recommend to use version `3`)

```yml
version: "3"
```

2. services - This will contains each of docker container

```yml
services:
  <service_name>:
    image: <image_name>:<image_tag>
```

Next, on each service you can setup parameters, environment or command to execute, here is impartant config you might need. Below configuration must place in `<service_name>` in **docker-compose.yml**

> I recommend to use **static version** to avoid break change.
> Static version is version with following format `vX.X.X` where `X` is number

1. [image][docker-compose-image] - image name and version to use
2. [restart][docker-compose-restart] - what do you need when container is down
3. [ports][docker-compose-port] - expose port from docker container to local machine. This will make you able to call application from local machine
4. [volumes][docker-compose-volume] - Normally after docker is stopped, all data in that container will be deleted as well. You can map data from directory/files to either local machine or docker internal volume, and data will stand forever (until you manually delete it)
5. [depends_on][docker-compose-depend] - To start current container after depends_on list. **Warning: This NOT wait application to fully started, it only wait docker to start**
6. [environment][docker-compose-environment] - Additional environment variable in containers
7. [healthcheck][docker-compose-healthcheck] - Help docker understand when ever application is down or crash
8. user - Override user (uid) in docker container by add `user: "1000"` in **docker-compose** file (not recommend)
9. [extra_hosts][docker-compose-host] - You can add `"host.docker.internal:host-gateway"` for calling local machine inside docker network

### Docker compose start

After you have file. You can run follow command in same directory of **docker-compose.yml**

```bash
# create and start and monitor docker-compose logs
docker-compose up
# create start docker-compose in background
docker-compose up -d
# only stop docker containers
docker-compose stop
# stop and delete all data relate to this docker-compose
docker-compose down
```

## Complete docker compose

This is my simplied **docker-compose.yml**

## FTMetric

> Docker: https://github.com/kamontat/fthelper/pkgs/container/ftmetric

I did open ftmetric source on [Github](https://github.com/kamontat/fthelper/tree/main/metric) today. On repository will decribe more how to configure and use this.

For short descibe. Ftmetric is prometheus [exporter][prometheus-exporter]. It will call [freqtrade rest apis][rest-apis] to get information and show as formatted syntax when someone call `/metrics` endpoint.

[prometheus-exporter]: https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/glossary/#exporter
[rest-apis]: https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/#rest-api

### Docker helpful commands

> This should use for POC only, NOT recommend for production

```bash
# show help
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/kamontat/ftmetric --help
# show all config listed on this script
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/kamontat/ftmetric --list-config
# quick run
docker run --rm -it -p 8090:8090 ghcr.io/kamontat/ftmetric \
  freqtrade.url=http://localhost:8080 \
  freqtrade.username=freqtrader \
  freqtrade.password=verysecretpassword
```

## Prometheus

Prometheus is time-series database. It need [target][prometheus-target] ([ftmetric](#ftmetric)) to pull data from. To config prometheus, you need [prometheus config](#prometheus-config-file) which will configure prometheus settings.

### Prometheus config file

> More detailed: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 1m
  scrape_timeout: 5s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: freqtrade
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - "ftmetric:8090"
```

1. scrape_interval - how many time prometheus wait before pulling new data
2. scrape_timeout - if target response time above timeout, it will force fail and try again new pulling
3. scrape_configs - contains targets to pull
   1. job_name - name show in prometheus metric label
   2. targets - pulling url, you can use `<service_name>` in **docker-compose** file as hostname if pulling from other docker container OR `host.docker.internal` if call it local machine (require setup `extra_hosts` in [docker](#docker-compose-file))

### Example

/assets/posts/3/example-prometheus.png

[prometheus-target]: https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/glossary/#target


### Prometheus Docker compose

Check [latest][prometheus-latest-version] version first

The `extra_host` will allow you to call server on your server (not in docker) by replacing `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`. This might be handy if you run your bot outside docker.

```yml
prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus:v2.28.0
  restart: on-failure
  # be aware that prometheus DOES NOT have builtin authentication
  # ports:
  #   - 9090:9090
  volumes:
    # you can config prometheus via this directory (prometheus.yml)
    - ./prometheus/config:/etc/prometheus/
  command:
    - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
  extra_hosts:
    - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

[prometheus-latest-version]: https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated

### Troubleshooting

If you found following logs, It might because you didn't has permission. You can either add permission to directory that you map from (**recommend**) or override uesr id in docker-compose

```
level=error ts=2021-07-06T10:44:08.309Z caller=query_logger.go:109 component=activeQueryTracker msg="Failed to create directory for logging active queries"
level=error ts=2021-07-06T10:44:08.309Z caller=query_logger.go:87 component=activeQueryTracker msg="Error opening query log file" file=data/queries.active err="open data/queries.active: no such file or directory"
panic: Unable to create mmap-ed active query log
```

## Grafana

Grafana is data visualization. Basically It can be replace `freqUI`. What Grafana do is query data from datasource and show them as beautiful graph. Default port of grafana is `3000`

### Setup

I already cover how to start/run grafana in [docker-compose](#complete-docker-compose) section. So I assume that you should able to open grafana at `<host>:3000`. Below is steps you need to setup grafana before it can query data

1. Add datasource via Configuration

/assets/posts/3/grafana-new-datasource.png

2. Add `Prometheus` datasource with following config
   1. url - `prometheus:9090` or name of docker-compose `<service_name>`
3. (optional) Additional of prometheus, you can add database as well (either `postgres` or `sqlite`)
4. (optional) Import predefined dashboard at [14632][grafana-dashboard]
